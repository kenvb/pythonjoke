# pythonjoke
I made this little piece of code as an assignment for the PCAP: essentials course I took on netacad: https://www.netacad.com/courses/programming/pcap-programming-essentials-python
This program grabs a joke from the internet and if you like it, saves it in a file. You can look at the jokes you liked
